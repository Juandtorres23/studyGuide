The ternary operator in JavaScript is a concise way to write an if-else statement in a single line.
Syntax:
JavaScript

condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
How it works:
Condition: The condition is evaluated as a boolean (true or false).
ExpressionIfTrue: If the condition evaluates to true, this expression is executed and its value is returned.
ExpressionIfFalse: If the condition evaluates to false, this expression is executed and its value is returned.
Example:
JavaScript

let age = 20;
let message = age >= 18 ? "Eligible to vote" : "Not eligible to vote";

console.log(message); // Output: "Eligible to vote"
